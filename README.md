# DoneWithIt
# React Native Mobile Application for selling used goods. 

## Selling Unwanted good with a click of A button 
Throw away culture is so last year. With DoneWithIt you can easily re-home gently used items with a a few simple clicks. 
This not only reduces the amount of items that end up in landfills, but It puts some extra coin in your purse! An all around good!

## Status of Project 
At this point the project is only completed on a front end basis. Meaning it is not fully user interactive. 
I intend to come back to this project within the next few weeks, and begin working through the back end. 
This is my first React Native application, and I followed tutorials as well as read the documentation to work through fleshing out a back end. 

## Problems 

One thing that did not make sense in the tutorials I used was the use of the useState() hook. I'm quite familiar with hooks, and found serveal locations where useState()
was used and should not have been. useMemo() should replace useState() in 2 components. I'm looking to sort that out after I build that back end out on the rare chance that
useState()'s behavior changes with actual data (if so I 100 % would like to know why.) 

## Experiece building for the 1st time (for others just starting with react native)

Learn React.js with function components before learning React Native.
